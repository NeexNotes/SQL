# Reporting with SQL

## Retrieving Results in a Particular Order

In this video we're going to take a look at ordering results, that is, retrieving data in a specific order.

#### Ordering by a single column criteria:

```sql
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC];
```

`ASC` is used to order results in ascending order.

`DESC` is used to order results in descending order.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY title ASC;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = "Sonic T-Shirt" ORDER BY stock_count DESC;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY signed_up_on DESC;
SELECT * FROM countries ORDER BY population DESC;
```

#### Ordering by multiple column criteria:

```sql
SELECT * FROM <table name> ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC],
                                    <column 2> [ASC|DESC],
                                    ...,
                                    <column n> [ASC|DESC];
```

Ordering is prioritized left to right.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC, 
                                title ASC;

SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY    genre ASC,
                                year_published DESC;

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY    last_name ASC,
                                first_name ASC;
```
## Limiting the Number of Results

Databases can store massive amounts of data, and often you don't want to bring back all of the results. It's slow and it affects the performance for other users. In most cases you only want a certain subset of the rows.

**SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL**

To limit the number of results returned, use the `LIMIT` keyword.

```sql lite
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> LIMIT <# of rows>;
SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT <# of rows>;
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <condition> LIMIT <# of rows>;
SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <column> DESC LIMIT <# of rows>;
SELECT * FROM books WHERE genre = "Fantasy" ORDER BY first_published LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM books WHERE genre = "Science Fiction" ORDER BY first_published DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**MS SQL**

To limit the number of results returned, use the `TOP` keyword.

```mssql
SELECT TOP <# of rows> <columns> FROM <table>;
```

**Oracle**

To limit the number of results returned, use the `ROWNUM` keyword in a `WHERE` clause.

```sql
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE ROWNUM <= <# of rows>;
```

## Paging Through Results

Limiting just by the top set of results is a fine thing, but let's say you wanted to generate a multi page report. Having a blog archive or listing search results in batches of 50 is where you want paging.

**SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL**  

To page through results you can either use the `OFFSET` keyword in conjunction with the `LIMIT` keyword or just with LIMIT alone.

```sql
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> LIMIT <# of rows> OFFSET <skipped rows>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> LIMIT <skipped rows>, <# of rows>;
```

**MS SQL and Oracle**  

To page through results you can either use the `OFFSET` keyword in conjunction with the `FETCH` keyword. Cannot be used with `TOP`.

```mssql
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> OFFSET <skipped rows> ROWS FETCH NEXT <# of rows> ROWS ONLY;
```
## Functions

You've seen keywords and operators, now it's time to see a new concept in the SQL programming language: functions.

**Syntax definitions**  

- **Keywords**: Commands issued to a database. The data presented in queries is unaltered.
- **Operators**: Performs comparisons and simple manipulation
- **Functions**: Presents data differently through more complex manipulation

A function looks like:

```sql
<function name>(<value or column>)
```

Example:

```sql
UPPER("Andrew Chalkley") 
```

### Adding Text Columns Together

You are not restricted by the column definitions in the database schema. You can join columns together so they're more human readable as one.

**SQLite, PostgreSQL and Oracle**  

Use the concatenation operator `||`.

```sql
SELECT <value or column> || <value or column> || <value or column>  FROM <table>;  
```

**MS SQL** 

Use the concatenation operator `+`.

```sql
SELECT <value or column> + <value or column> + <value or column>  FROM <table>;  
```

**MySQL, Postgres and MS SQL**  

Use the `CONCAT()` function.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(<value or column>, <value or column>, <value or column>) FROM <table>;
```

**example**

```sql
SELECT first_name || " " || last_name || " <" || email ||">" AS "to_field" FROM patrons;
```


| to_field                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Andrew Chalkley <andrew@teamtreehouse.com> |
| Dave McFarland <dave@teamtreehouse.com>    |
| Alena Holligan <alena@teamtreehouse.com>   |
| Michael Poley <michael@teamtreehouse.com>  |

### Finding the Length of Text

ou can obtain lengths of pieces of text using the LENGTH() function. To obtain the length of a value or column use the LENGTH() function.

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(<value or column>) FROM <tables>;
```

### Changing the Case of Text Columns

There are two functions for changing cases, UPPER() and LOWER(). Let's look how to use them.

Use the `UPPER()` function to uppercase text.

```sql
SELECT UPPER(<value or column>) FROM <table>;
```

Use the `LOWER()` function to lowercase text.

```sql
SELECT LOWER(<value or column>) FROM <table>;
```

### Creating Excerpts From Text

Wouldn't it be cool to create excerpts like this...

To create smaller strings from larger piece of text you can use the SUBSTR() funciton or the substring function.'

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR(<value or column>, <start>, <length>) FROM <table>;
SELECT name, SUBSTR(description, 1, 30) || "..." FROM products;
```
### Replacing Portions of Text

Replacing parts of text is handy for privacy concerns, standardization or improving output.

To replace piece of strings of text in a larger body of text you can use the `REPLACE()` function.

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(<original value or column>, <target string>, <replacement string>) FROM <table>;

SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE REPLACE(state, "California", "CA") = "CA"; ???
SELECT REPLACE(email, "@", "<at>") as obfuscated_email FROM customers;
```

## Counting Results

### Counting Rows

Counting the number of rows is great for answering questions such as "How many users do we have?" and "How many sales happened this week?".

To count rows you can use the `COUNT()` function.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table>;
```

To count unique entries use the `DISTINCT` keyword too:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <column>) FROM <table>;
```

example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "scifi_book_count" FROM books WHERE genre = "Science Fiction";
```

### Counting Groups of Rows

Itâ€™s often handy to group rows together to count them. For example you could answer the question "How many books are in each genre?"

To count aggregated rows with common values use the `GROUP BY` keywords:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(<column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <column with common value>;
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS product_count FROM products GROUP BY category;
```

```
Books 20
CDes 34
Shoes 12
```

### Getting the Grand Total

Calculating grand totals are handy for answering questions like "How much was spent today on the site?" and "What are the total number of goals scored by a particular team?"

o total up numeric columns use the `SUM()` function.

```sql
SELECT SUM(<numeric column) FROM <table>;
SELECT SUM(<numeric column) AS <alias> FROM <table>
                                       GROUP BY <another column>
                                       HAVING <alias> <operator> <value>;
```

```sql
SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_spent, user_id FROM orders
											GROUP BY user_id
											HAVING total_spent > 250
											ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

The `HAVING` keyword works just like like `WHERE`, but WHERE cannot be used before GROUP BY because 

### Calculating Averages

Averages are great for calculating averages of scores, reviews and sales.

To get the average value of a numeric column use the `AVG()` function.

```sql
SELECT AVG(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT AVG(<numeric column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <other column>;
```
```sql
SELECT AVG(cost) FROM orders;
-- one big number for the average of all orders

SELECT AVG(cost), user_id FROM orders GROUP BY user_id;
-- a bunch of numbers for each user, showing the user id as well

SELECT AVG(rating) AS average_rating FROM reviews WHERE movie_id = 6;
-- an average rating for a movie from all reviews in db
```

### Getting Minimum and Maximum Values

Finding the minimum and maximum values for particular column can help you get an insight in to what's happening in your data.

To get the maximum value of a numeric column use the `MAX()` function.

```sql
SELECT MAX(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT MAX(<numeric column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <other column>;
```

To get the minimum value of a numeric column use the `MIN()` function.

```sql
SELECT MIN(<numeric column>) FROM <table>;
SELECT MIN(<numeric column>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <other column>;
```
### Performing Math on Numeric Types

Operators aren't only for comparing values or concatenating strings. They can be used to perform mathematical operations.

**Mathematical Operators**  

- `*` Multiply
- `/` Divide
- `+` Add
- `-` Subtract

```sql
SELECT <numeric column> <mathematical operator> <numeric value> FROM <table>;
```

#### rounding numbers

```sql
SELECT name, price * 1.06 AS "With tax" FROM products;
SELECT name, ROUND(price * 1.06) AS "With tax" FROM products;
SELECT name, ROUND(price * 1.06, 2) AS "With tax" FROM products; -- rounded to 2 decimal places
```

### Differences Between Databases

* Dates, how written
* Functions for dates
* Formatting dates

**Creating Up-to-the-Minute Reports**  

One of the powerful features in SQL is writing queries based on today's date and time. We'll use a function to get today's date.

#### SQLite

To get the **current date** use: `DATE("now")`

To get the **current time** use: `TIME("now")`

To get the **current date** time: `DATETIME("NOW")`

#### MS SQL

To get the current date use: `CONVERT(date, GETDATE())`

To get the current time use: `CONVERT(time, GETDATE())`

To get the current date time: `GETDATE()`

#### MySQL

To get the current date use: `CURDATE()`

To get the current time use: `CURTIME()`

To get the current date time: `NOW()`

#### Oracle and PostgreSQL

To get the current date use: `CURRENT_DATE`

To get the current time use: `CURRENT_TIME`

To get the current date time: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

**Example:** 

 In an ecommerce database there's an `orders` table with the columns `id`, `product_id`, `user_id`, `address_id`, `ordered_on`, `status` and `cost`.

Count the total number of orders that have the `status` of `shipped` today. Alias it to `shipped_today`.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shipped_today FROM orders 
									WHERE status = "shipped" 
									AND ordered_on = DATE("now");
```

### Calculating dates

Calculating dates are great for generating reports and dashboards that are dynamic in nature. Documentation Links for Calculating Dates

- [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2012/12-jan/o12plsql-1408561.html)

SQLite:

```sql
DATE("2016-02-01");
DATE("2016-02-01", "-7 days");
DATE("2016-02-01", "+ 2 months");
DATE("2016-02-01", "-2 months", "-7 days "); -- chaining modifiers
```

Show orders between 2 dates:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE ordered_on
							BETWEEN DATE("now", "-7 days") 
								AND DATE("now", "-1 day");
							-- today is still happening so we do it till yesterday
```

**Example**  

In an ecommerce database there's an `orders` table with the columns `id`, `product_id`, `user_id`, `address_id`, `ordered_on`, `status` and `cost`.

Count the total number of orders that have the `status` of `shipped` and were ordered yesterday. Alias it to `shipped_yesterday`.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shipped_yesterday FROM orders 
										WHERE status = "shipped" 
										  AND ordered_on = DATE("now", "-1 day");
```

### Formatting Dates For Reporting

The dates stored in a database often don't suit a human reader. In this video we'll update the dates to be more friendly!
